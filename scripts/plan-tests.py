"""CI v2 test planner for Hermes Conduit.

Replaces the static unit-a..unit-d shard system:

  * discovers every XCTestCase class under ConduitTests/ and ConduitUITests/
    directly from the Swift sources (no Xcode runtime discovery needed);
  * validates complete, duplicate-free inventory (a new test class cannot
    silently miss CI);
  * assigns unit classes to a dynamic number of lanes with longest-
    processing-time-first balancing over historical duration estimates,
    consolidating lanes whose split would not buy more than a wall-clock
    tolerance once the fixed per-invocation Xcode/simulator startup cost is
    modeled (predicted lane cost = invocation overhead + predicted execution);
  * partitions every unit lane's classes, in stored order, into sequential
    execution BATCHES of at most 7 classes - each batch runs as its own
    fresh xcodebuild invocation with its own planned watchdog on the same
    runner and Simulator session (see MAX_UNIT_CLASSES_PER_XCODEBUILD_BATCH);
  * balances UI classes into their own parallel lanes the same way, and
    derives a PER-CLASS watchdog for every UI class (the lane runs its
    classes as one batched invocation priced at the sum of those budgets,
    and the diagnosis fallback enforces them per class);
  * derives measured per-lane watchdog budgets from those predictions;
  * emits GitHub Actions matrix JSON for the dynamic unit AND UI lanes.

Subcommands
-----------
plan             Validate + write plan.json / unit-matrix.json / summary md.
validate         Same validation, human report, no files written (cheap Linux guard).
audit-xctestrun  Fail unless all absolute paths inside a built .xctestrun live
                 under the workspace root (build-once artifact portability gate).

Determinism: identical inputs produce byte-identical outputs (no timestamps).
Timing input precedence: --history (Actions-cache timing history) > --baseline
(checked-in fallback) > DEFAULT_ESTIMATE_S for unseen classes. Corrupt or
missing timing files never fail planning.
