#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# CI v2 lane runner: execute ONE dynamically planned test lane from the shared
# build products (test-without-building; never rebuilds).
#
# Unit lanes execute their planner-assigned classes as SEQUENTIAL SMALL
# xcodebuild batches (at most 7 classes per invocation; each batch is a fresh
# xcodebuild/XCTest/testhost process on the SAME runner and the SAME Simulator
# session - no erase or reset between successful batches). UI lanes
# batch every class of the shard into ONE invocation on the healthy path
# (multiple -only-testing filters), so a successful shard pays Xcode/
# CoreSimulator/test-session startup once instead of once per class. Any
# batch-level failure falls back to per-class diagnosis (each class its own
# invocation under its own planned watchdog), so one hung class can never
# hold the rest of the suite hostage and failure is still attributed - and
# retried - at class granularity; ordinary test failures never even get
# there: they retry ONLY the failed test methods (exact method when the
# xcresult identifies them, the class otherwise) in a single follow-up
# invocation, and healthy classes are never re-executed.
#
# Failure-domain policy (docs/CI.md):
#   1. Ordinary test failures never rerun healthy work. Unit batches run
#      with Xcode-native flake retry (-retry-tests-on-failure
#      -test-iterations N), which re-executes only the failing tests. If
#      failures survive those iterations the LANE FAILS on that batch - no
#      batch-level retry masquerades as recovery, and earlier batches keep
#      their recorded passes. UI batches get one TARGETED retry of just the
#      failed tests (methods when identifiable, else classes); passing
#      classes are never re-executed.
#   2. An invocation whose XCTest result CANNOT be classified (timing/result
#      extraction failed) is a FAILURE. Timing extraction is best-effort and
#      must never decide test correctness, so an unclassifiable failure is
#      never retried into a green lane - the batch fails its lane.
#   3. An invocation that exits nonzero with a KNOWN zero failing-test count
#      is confidently an infrastructure failure (simulator crash, runner
#      exit, ...). Units retry THAT BATCH ONCE after a bounded simulator
#      erase (the historical recovery, scoped to the batch instead of the
#      whole lane); a second infrastructure failure fails the lane with the
#      batch named. A UI batch cannot attribute a wedge to a class, so it
#      erases the simulator and re-runs the affected classes through
#      per-class diagnosis. If the simulator recovery itself cannot be
#      trusted (erase failed, UDID unresolvable, boot never completed),
#      later results would be misleading: the lane stops there.
#   4. A watchdog timeout is positive identification of a hang. Units retry
#      THAT BATCH ONCE with a fresh xcodebuild process on the same runner
#      and Simulator (bounded shutdown only - NO erase; the fresh-process
#      boundary IS the recovery, per the sequential-invocation diagnostic
#      that showed stalled workloads completing when re-entered through a
#      new xcodebuild). A second stall fails the lane with the batch as the
#      identified culprit. A UI batch timeout cannot name the hung class, so
#      it erases and enters the same per-class diagnosis, where a class that
#      hangs twice names the culprit, fails the lane, and stops it (its
#      simulator state is contaminated) while earlier results are kept and
#      later classes are recorded as not_diagnosed so a contaminated
#      simulator cannot produce misleading secondary failures.
#
# Batch layouts and per-batch watchdog budgets for unit lanes are owned by
# plan-tests.py alone (--batches-json is the single source of that policy;
# the runner refuses to start unless the batches exactly reproduce the
# lane's planned class order). UI watchdog budgets are likewise owned by
# plan-tests.py: every UI lane receives an explicit per-class budget table
# (--class-timeouts) and the runner refuses to start unless it covers every
# assigned class - there is no fallback formula here to drift from the
# planner.
#
# Every simctl operation is deadline-bounded (ci-lib.sh). Bash 3.2 compatible.

# --- unit lane: sequential fresh-xcodebuild batches ---------------------------
#
# Evidence (PRs #178-#183): large single unit invocations repeatedly
# watchdog-stalled on hosted macos-26 regardless of membership - audio was
# exonerated, a 30-class cap did not help, the reproducing set narrowed to
# 14 classes, and those same 14 completed as two 7-class invocations run
# back-to-back in ONE job on ONE runner with ONE Simulator session (only the
# xcodebuild/XCTest/testhost process was fresh between them). So the lane's
# planned classes execute batch by batch:
#
#   * pass      -> next batch; the Simulator is never reset/erased between
#                  successful batches (the fresh process is the boundary);
#   * real test failures surviving the native in-invocation retry, or an
#     unclassifiable result -> the lane FAILS on that batch;
#   * watchdog stall OR infrastructure wedge (nonzero exit, KNOWN zero
#     failures) -> THIS batch retries ONCE: fresh xcodebuild, same runner,
#     same Simulator. The watchdog path adds only a bounded simulator
#     shutdown (NO erase); the infra path keeps the historical
#     erase-before-retry. A second stall fails the lane with the batch
#     named - exactly one batch-level retry ever, never a lane rerun.
