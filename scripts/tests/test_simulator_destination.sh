# Regression tests for the destination-readiness lookup in scripts/ci-lib.sh.
#
# Covers the exact numeric-component OS matcher, the runtime-key version
# extraction, and the OS-qualified simulator_udid() end to end against a
# fixture `simctl list devices available -j` payload (bounded_run is
# overridden; no simulator, no real xcrun). The fixture carries iPhone 17 Pro
# on iOS 26.0, 26.1, and 26.10 so the 26.1-vs-26.10 discrimination is
# observable.
#
# jq is required only for the simulator_udid() fixture cases; on hosts
# without jq those cases are skipped (the pure-bash matcher cases always
# run). Usage: bash scripts/tests/test_simulator_destination.sh
# (exit 0 = all cases pass)
