# Voice settings & provider configuration

How Conduit's Voice settings map onto the Hermes profile configuration, and
what the provider endpoint overrides do and do not change.

## Where TTS requests run

All speech synthesis is relayed through the user's Hermes host: Conduit calls
`/api/audio/speak-stream` (streamed PCM) on the Hermes server and falls back
to `/api/audio/speak` (whole-file) when streaming is unavailable. Conduit
never talks to TTS providers directly, and it never uses Hermes'
`voice.client_direct` credential hand-off — provider API keys remain on the
Hermes host, where Conduit can only see whether each key is set.

## Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints

The OpenAI TTS provider accepts two endpoint overrides:

- `tts.openai.base_url` — points Hermes at any OpenAI-compatible speech
  endpoint (for example `https://your-host/v1`). This configures the provider
  **Hermes** calls; it does not change the server Conduit connects to, and it
  is not the Hermes dashboard URL. Clearing the field removes the override
  key from the profile config, returning the provider to its default.
- `tts.openai.speed` — speech rate multiplier. Upstream clamps values into
  0.25–4.0; Conduit validates and refuses out-of-range or malformed input
  rather than saving something upstream would silently rewrite, and accepts
  comma decimals (`1,5` is stored as `1.5`). Clearing the field removes the
  override key, restoring the upstream/global default. Note: this setting
  applies to Hermes' whole-file OpenAI synthesis — upstream's current PCM
  streaming implementation does not consume it.

The ElevenLabs provider exposes the analogous `tts.elevenlabs.base_url`
(applied by Hermes to both whole-file and streaming synthesis); its
`voice_id`/`model_id` editors write the keys upstream actually reads.
Clearing any text override removes the key from the profile config — Hermes
falls back to the provider default when a key is absent. Its
`wss_url` key is intentionally not offered: Hermes derives it from
`base_url` when unset.

`tts.openai.instruction` is deliberately **not** editable: upstream Hermes
resolves speaking style through the per-request TTS tool parameter and never
reads that config key.

## Streaming vs fallback

OpenAI-compatible does not guarantee streaming compatibility. Hermes decides
streaming per provider: when its configured provider has a chunked-PCM
implementation, `/api/audio/speak-stream` returns streamed PCM; otherwise the
server explicitly signals `fallback` and Conduit fetches whole-file audio
from `/api/audio/speak`. A provider selected for streaming whose streaming
request fails before producing audio also falls back client-side. Conduit's
provider test therefore reports success only when audible speech data was
actually delivered — a silent stream is a failed test, not a pass.

## What Conduit does not expose

Local-engine and server-administration knobs (Whisper device/compute
settings, Piper paths and tuning, command-provider command definitions,
warm/release commands, process environment) remain Hermes-host
administration concerns and are intentionally not mirrored here. Unknown or
plugin providers discovered by Hermes still appear in the pickers with the
generic model/language/voice fields.
