//  Round 6: the explicit Repair Connection flow's value types and its
//  activation boundary. Repair reuses the Connection Setup wizard, probe,
//  failure taxonomy, and the authoritative AppState connection path; this
//  file only owns the small set of types that let a validated test result
//  become an explicit reconnect WITHOUT widening access to secrets.
//
//  Security shape: a validated native transaction (ticket + transaction
//  cookies) lives only inside ConnectionRepairCandidate — memory only,
//  never logged, never persisted, never Equatable, absent from every debug
//  description. It is invalidated by draft edits, newer test runs,
//  cancellation, dismissal, and consumption; the wizard checks the same
//  revision/generation that produced the staged success before use.
