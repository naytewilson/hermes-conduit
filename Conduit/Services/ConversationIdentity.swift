/// One conversation's identity inside a profile, separating the two kinds of
/// session identifier the app handles.
///
/// - `profile` is capture metadata for the owning workspace. `admit` does not
///   compare it: AppState's reconciliation guards (`profile == activeProfile`
///   at every resume await boundary) enforce profile currency before the gate
///   runs. Profile comparison styles differ across subsystems, so the fence
///   stays where it is already enforced.
/// - `durableSessionID` is the stable UI/persistence identity: the catalog
///   row's stored id, or the id the resume store persisted. It is present
///   only when positively established; a brand-new runtime-only conversation
///   has none until the catalog or a resume response names one.
/// - `runtimeSessionID` is the routing identity Hermes currently answers to.
///   It may rotate (`runtime-old` → `runtime-new`); rotation is a transport
///   rebind of the same conversation, never a navigation to a new one.
/// - `acceptedSessionIDs` holds every identifier POSITIVELY confirmed
///   equivalent to this conversation at capture time: the selected id, its
///   catalog row's ids, and the scroll identity's confirmed aliases. It must
///   be captured before any catalog replacement — a refreshed catalog is
///   allowed to have temporarily forgotten the runtime alias, and that
///   absence is not evidence about the conversation's identity.
///
/// Catalog absence is not navigation authority: this value, not the newest
/// catalog snapshot, decides what preserve-current recovery owns.
