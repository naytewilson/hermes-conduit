/// Profile-scoped index of POSITIVELY confirmed runtime→durable conversation
/// mappings. It answers exactly two questions:
///
///     What durable conversation is runtime-a positively known to belong to?
///     (lookups — consumers such as notification routing)
///
/// and nothing more. It is NOT a second session state machine:
/// `ConversationIdentity` remains the ownership value, and the index only
/// centralizes the alias evidence that used to live exclusively inside
/// per-operation `acceptedSessionIDs` captures, so it survives across
/// operations instead of dying with each capture.
///
/// Evidence policy: mappings are recorded ONLY from positively verified
/// sources (admitted resume results, explicitly labeled catalog rows,
/// `session.active_list` rows, verified create/branch responses, and
/// notification payloads that carry both identities). Catalog ordering,
/// timestamps, title equality, string resemblance, and profile co-membership
/// are NEVER evidence, and no caller may synthesize a mapping from them.
///
/// Authority rules — who may establish, and who may REBIND a mapping that
/// historical evidence already confirmed. Callers pick the API by authority,
/// never by convenience:
///
///     Evidence                          API                   May establish?  May rebind?
///     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
///     historical confirmed alias        record(...)           yes             no
///     dual-ID notification payload      record(...)           yes             no
///     admitted session.resume           recordAuthoritative() yes             yes
///     authoritative catalog snapshot    recordCatalogIdentity yes             yes (first claim per snapshot)
///     session.active_list row           recordAuthoritative() yes             yes
///     verified create result            recordAuthoritative() yes             yes (created conversation)
///     verified branch result            recordAuthoritative() yes             yes (branched conversation)
///
/// The rule behind the table: when the app has already ACCEPTED fresh
/// routing evidence into conversation-owned state (an admitted resume, the
/// live registry, a response the catalog now reflects), the index must not
/// disagree with it — the app cannot say one thing while its own shared
/// index says another. Historical observations and unverified payload
/// claims, by contrast, never overwrite a fresher confirmed mapping; they
/// surface a conflict for the caller to log and resolve.
///
/// Scope: every mapping is keyed by the normalized profile. Runtime ids from
/// one profile can never establish or resolve ownership in another, and
/// `removeAll()` (the server-change boundary) drops everything so mappings
/// from one Hermes server are never usable on another.
