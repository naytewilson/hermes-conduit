//  Pure mapping from the shared VoiceConversationController's published state
//  to the at-most-five states the CarPlay CPVoiceControlTemplate displays.
//  CarPlay is a state/control surface, never a mirrored chat window: no
//  transcript text, reasoning, or failure detail ever crosses this boundary —
//  the associated failure message of `.failed` is deliberately dropped here.
